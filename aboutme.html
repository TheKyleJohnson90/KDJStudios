          <h5>My Younger Experience</h5>
	      Ever since I held Legos in my hands and realized the endless possibilities a bunch of similar bricks could be combined to produce such intrinsic and very different results. Guess one may say Legos inspired my life. It was later on in High School that I took my first software development class. In which we took apart a PC, had to memorize all parts and there names and put it back together working the next day. It was during which this came so naturally to me and felt like Legos. Yet later in the class We started development in QBasic. This captivated me with the basic structurally programming. It was after this class that I took up coding in Blitz Basic as a hobby and developed a few simple (and I mean very basic) games. After enrolling in a AutoCAD drafting class with the same teacher; During the first day I was inclined to show him my latest project. After which, he had me transferred into the next Programming course they offered in which I learned Visual Basic and developed a simple Hangman application. I then finished High School and moved out to Washington to attend DeVry University to further my knowledge and skills in the field. I have now graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Game and Simulation Programming.
