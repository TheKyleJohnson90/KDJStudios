                    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
                    <p>Vibrant and Verbose, yet a simple quote can summarize my life. "Life engenders life. Energy creates energy. It is by spending oneself that one becomes rich." * Sarah Bernhardt </p>

                    <h2>What I Do</h2>
                    <p>Some call me a code monkey, and I can not agree more. I have been the victim of years of computer integration with daily life and see the need to adapt technology to us.</p>

                    <h2>My Scene</h2>
                    <p>Born and raised in Billings, Montana. I moved to Washington for college; while, I love the outdoors, music, and horticulture. Also great influences from my friends, family and special thanks for Ma and Pa!</p>

                    <h2>Contact</h2>
                    <p>So! So! So! busy, The best form of contact is via email, I do not usually use an IM; so please excuse any latency in responses!</p>
